Descriptions of each file/function
NOTE: No file of use cases and queries as it wouldn't make much sense
      and would be hard to tell where they are, instead they have been
      added as comments

setup.sh
    installs dependencies for flask to run and setup anything else
create.sql
    created to create database in lieu of setup.sql as ffserver.py
    must be run at least once to create proper tables
setup.sql
    unused to import database files as sql alchemy dependencies cause errors
ffserver.py
    creates the app then runs it on localhost port 8888

FindFolks - folder containing server python files
__init__.py
    initializes the app and creates the database tables
auth.py
    defines blueprint bound functions for authorization processes (register/login)
config.py
    sqlalchemy configuration settings
errors.py
    defines blueprint bound functions for errors
models.py
    contains sql alchemy where the columns of each entity is defined
utils.py
    unused utilities initialization
views.py
    defines blueprint bound functions for rendering most webpages
    NOTE: many queries in this retrieve more info than is rendered
          the rendering just chooses the necessary element
          (ie. groups = ... SELECT belongs_to.group_id, group_name FROM ... in .py
               {% groups[1] %} in .html would output just group name)

project Folder - unneeded folder to hold virtualenv included out of habit
    venv Folder - folder containing the virtual environment
        bin Folder - contains dependencies installed via shell script
                     also contains the activate executable to start env
        include Folder - contains reference to python folder of header files
        lib Folder - contains python source files

static Folder - contains bootstrap formatting
NOTE: 13 NOT developed code, taken from bootswatch
      which provides free bootstrap themes

templates Folder - holds the html templates for each webpage
    errors Folder - html pages for errors
    base.html - webpage that every other page is built off of excluding errors
    index.html is the FindFolks page, every other file is the
               html for the corresponding name of the page
               NOTE: many templates use a subscript to identify the desired element
                     to be rendered onto the screen
                     (ie. groups = ... SELECT belongs_to.group_id, group_name FROM ... in .py
                          {% groups[1] %} in .html would output just group name)
