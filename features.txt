Additional features added.

1. Send emails for registration (commented out)
   and email reminders for events (not commented out)
   feature is implemented properly but may not work
   because it uses an email API mailgun which has not
   yet verified us as a non spam service.

2. Better password security implemented using sha512
   and sha256 with bcrypt which generates a random
   salt protecting against rainbow/lookup tables.

3. Use of bootstrap to create a visually appealing website.

4. Show groups with similar interests

5. All optionally functionality added.
   (eg. timestamps/range used various times)

6. Reasonably complex constraints. Can't add already added friends.
   Can't add already added interests. Can only search groups by list
   of interests groups have.

7. Reasonably complex display. Event search lists host, title, data,
   and much more all layed out nicely.

8. There is code for a password reset written, but
   not in use because it sends an email verification
   and without mailgun verification, the user would
   be indefinitely locked out.

9. Not functionality but wrote a shell script that
   originally installed all necessary packages,
   created a corresponding python virtual env then
   immediately ran the server. Still works, but not
   when externally populating the database with
   SQL statements run from command line.
